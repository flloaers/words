    "> **Definition 1.1.** For $A$ a nonempty set and $n$ a nonnegative integer we define $A^0 = \\lbrace \\varnothing \\rbrace$, and, for $n > 0$, $A^n$ is the set of $n$-tuples of elements from $A^n$ to $A$. An *$n$-ary operation* (or *function*) *on $A$* is any function $f$ from $A^n$ to $A$; $n$ is the *arity* (or *rank*) of $f$. A *finitary* operation is an $n$-ary operation, for some $n$. The image of $\\langle a_1, \\dots, a_n \\rangle$ under an $n$-ary operation $f$ is denoted by $f(a_1,\\dots,a_n)$. An operation $f$ on $A$ is called a *nullary* operation (or *constant*) if its arity is zero; it is completely determined by the image $f(\\varnothing)$ in $A$ of the only element $\\varnothing$ in $A^0$, and as such it is convenient to identify it with the element $f(\\varnothing)$. Thus a nullary operation is thought of as an element of $A$. An operation $f$ on $A$ is *unary*, *binary* or *ternary* if its arity is 1, 2, or 3, respectively.\n",
