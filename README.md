###### Family: -hedra.
###### Siblings: dodecahedron, amplituhedron. 

## graticule
<!--#### Etymology
from Latin crāticula, diminutive form of crātis (bundle of brush, fascine; framework, network, lattice; bush-harrow)-->

<!--1. A grid of horizontal and vertical lines.
2. (_specifically, optics_) A reticle. 
3. (_specifically, geography_) The network of lines of latitude and longitude that make up a coordinate system such as the one used for the Earth. 
4. A nearly square or nearly rectangular region created by a graticule.-->

> A _graticule_ is a set of parallels and meridians at equal spacing in degrees.

###### Family: deriving from a Latin diminutive in -(c)ulus, -(c)ula, or -(c)ulum.
###### Siblings: malleolus, particle.

## arity 
> **Definition 1.1.** For $$A$$ a nonempty set and $$n$$ a nonnegative integer we define $$A^0=\lbrace \varnothing \rbrace$$, and, for $$n > 0$$, $$A^n$$ is the set of $$n$$-tuples of elements from $$A$$. An _$$n$$-ary operation_ (or _function_) _on $$A$$_ is any function $$f$$ from $$A^n$$ to $$A$$; $$n$$ is the _arity_ (or _rank_) of _f_. A _finitary_ operation is an $$n$$-ary operation, for some $$n$$. The image of $$\langle a_1, \dots, a_n \rangle$$ under an $$n$$-ary operation $$f$$ is denoted by $$f(a_1,\dots,a_n)$$. An operation $$f$$ on $$A$$ is called a _nullary_ operation (or _constant_) if its arity is zero; it is completely determined by the image $$f(\varnothing)$$ in $$A$$ of the only element $$\varnothing$$ in $$A^0$$, and as such it is convenient to identify it with the element $$f(\varnothing)$$. Thus a nullary operation is thought of as an element of $$A$$. An operation $$f$$ on $$A$$ is _unary_, _binary_ or _ternary_ if its arity is 1, 2, or 3, respectively.
